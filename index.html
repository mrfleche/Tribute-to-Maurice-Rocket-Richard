        <p>Here are Ten fun facts about Maurice Richard:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Fact 1</strong> - The “Rocket” was the most prolific goal-scorer of his era, the first to achieve the feat of 50 goals in 50 games.</li>
			<li><strong>Fact 2</strong> - He retired as the NHL's all-time leading scorer.</li>
			<li><strong>Fact 3</strong> - Richard was the first to score 50 goals in one season (the 1944–45 NHL season), doing so in 50 games, and the first to score 500 goals in a career.</li>
			<li><strong>Fact 4</strong> - Richard won the Stanley Cup eight times in Montreal, was captain for four of the five straight cup wins from 1955-56 to 1959-60, won the Hart Trophy in 1947, was elected eight times to the first all-star team and six times to the second all-star team, and played in every National Hockey League All-Star Game from 1947 to 1959.</li>
			<li><strong>Fact 5</strong> - He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1961, the customary three-year waiting period being waived in his honor.</li>
			<li><strong>Fact 6</strong> - Teamed with Elmer Lach as center and Hector ‘Toe’ Blake playing left-wing, they formed the “Punch Line”.</li>
			<li><strong>Fact 7</strong> - Richard was an outstanding scorer. While he had a good fore-hand and back-hand shot, he was not considered to have the greatest shot or accuracy. Richard made up for it in desire and other skills to become the outstanding goal-scorer of his time.</li>
			<li><strong>Fact 8</strong> - Richard's career began and ended before the beginning of huge salaries. The largest yearly salary he ever made was $25,000 in 1952 ($211 thousand in 2013 dollars).</li>
			<li><strong>Fact 9</strong> - The Jane Siberry song “Hockey” contains the line "They rioted in the streets of Montreal/When they benched Rocket Richard".</li>
			<li><strong>Fact 10</strong> - The local media first nicknamed him The Comet. During an intra-squad practice, Ray Getliffe was so impressed by him, he compared him to a rocket.</li>
